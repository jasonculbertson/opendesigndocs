# One-Pagers

    A one-pager is a short description of key elements of a project. Think of it as a quick summary for project stakeholders and cross-functional collaborators. A one-pager should communicate project requirements—without bogging down stakeholders with too many details. One-pagers are created at the very beginning of a project.

## Key elements of a one-pager

A one-pager should be a condensed version of your project spec and should include these elements:

- Background and project overview
- Project objectives and success metrics
- Target audience
- Deliverables and constraints
- Project timeline
- Additional resources and stakeholders

### Background and project overview

The first part of your project brief should include the project overview. The project background section is a space for you to provide any context your stakeholders might not have. Aim to answer questions like:

- What are we working on
  - Do any previous projects relate to this one?
- Why are we working on it
  - What business needs, research, or customer feedback, if any, led to this project?
- What is our goal(s)

### Project objectives and success metrics

Project objectives are the assets and deliverables you plan to deliver at the end of your project. Good project objectives help you get a clear understanding of your project. Your project objectives will define your success metrics, which should be:

- Specific
- Measurable
- Achievable
- Realistic
- Time-bound

### Deliverables and constraints

What are the actual items that will be need to sent to the engineering team. What constraints, if any, exist that the team should be aware of prior to beginning work on the project.

### Target audience

Knowing the target audience or persona is critical for project success. This includes insight into relevant audience demographics in order to produce the best work possible. Defining your target audience early can also prevent scope creep.

### Project timeline

A project timeline is the best way to give a team a clear idea of key dates and important project milestones. Timelines should include:

- Kickoff
- Wireframe checkin (depending upon t-shirt size)
- Design review (with design leadership)
- Product review
- Final handoff (design → eng)
- QA (design + eng)

### Additional resources and stakeholders

Link any relevant documentation that your team might need to access. As well, include any stakeholders from other squads that need to be included in the project. Consider whether these stakeholders should be at the project kickoff as well.
