# Design T-shirt sizing

    T-shirt sizing is a project estimation and capacity planning tool that helps you track how much time or effort an initiative will take. It should help in planning timelines for one pagers. To do this, you assign each project or task a t-shirt size—from XS to XL —to represent that project's relative effort. The T-shirt size should be noted in Jira as well.
