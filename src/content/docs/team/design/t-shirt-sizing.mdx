# T-shirt Sizing for Design Projects

## Overview

T-shirt sizing is a relative estimation technique that helps teams quickly assess project scope and complexity using familiar sizes: XS, S, M, L, XL.

## Size Definitions

### XS (Extra Small)
- 1-2 days
- Single screen/component
- Minimal complexity
- No dependencies
- Clear requirements

### S (Small)
- 3-5 days
- 2-3 screens/components
- Low complexity
- Few dependencies
- Well-defined scope

### M (Medium)
- 1-2 weeks
- 4-6 screens/components
- Moderate complexity
- Some dependencies
- Some unknowns

### L (Large)
- 2-4 weeks
- 7-10 screens/components
- High complexity
- Multiple dependencies
- Significant unknowns

### XL (Extra Large)
- 4+ weeks
- 10+ screens/components
- Very high complexity
- Many dependencies
- Major unknowns

## Estimation Process

### 1. Project Breakdown
- List key deliverables
- Identify components
- Note dependencies
- Consider constraints

### 2. Size Assessment
- Review complexity
- Check dependencies
- Consider unknowns
- Account for reviews

### 3. Team Discussion
- Share initial sizes
- Discuss differences
- Reach consensus
- Document rationale

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use
- Sprint planning
- Resource allocation
- Roadmap planning
- Capacity planning
- Project proposals

### Best Practices
1. Keep it simple
2. Use relative sizing
3. Consider all factors
4. Update as needed
5. Document assumptions

### Common Factors
- Design complexity
- Technical requirements
- Stakeholder involvement
- Research needs
- Testing requirements

## Implementation Tips

1. Start Small
- Begin with simple projects
- Build estimation skill
- Calibrate team understanding
- Document learnings

2. Regular Reviews
- Compare estimates vs actuals
- Adjust sizing guidelines
- Share learnings
- Improve accuracy

3. Team Alignment
- Common understanding
- Consistent application
- Regular calibration
- Clear communication
