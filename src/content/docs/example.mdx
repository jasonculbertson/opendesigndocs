# Getting Started with Design Systems

A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications.

## Why Design Systems Matter

Design systems help teams build better products faster by:

1. Ensuring consistency across products
2. Reducing design debt
3. Speeding up the development process
4. Improving collaboration between designers and developers

## Key Components

### Design Tokens

Design tokens are the smallest building blocks of a design system. They include:

- Colors
- Typography
- Spacing
- Shadows
- Border radii

### Component Library

A well-structured component library should include:

- Basic elements (buttons, inputs, etc.)
- Complex components (cards, modals, etc.)
- Patterns (forms, navigation, etc.)

## Best Practices

- Document everything
- Version your system
- Get stakeholder buy-in
- Plan for maintenance
- Test thoroughly
