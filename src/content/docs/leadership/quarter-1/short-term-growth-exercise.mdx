    Establishing quarterly goals aligns designers' efforts with organizational objectives, ensuring their work directly contributes to the company's success. This approach provides clear direction and measurable milestones, keeping designers focused and accountable. By structuring your goals around the 4Ps (Project, Process, People, Personal) methodology, designers can better manage their focus and time, ultimately leading to higher quality design outcomes.
