As a design leader, the first week at a company I share my leadership blueprint - a document that shows how I lead, my expectations for others and for myself.  This is shared with each person whom I manage after our first 1:1.  Below is an example:

As a leader, I am here to inspire and deliver outstanding results for the entire design team through clear strategy, process, and models of collaboration.

As a manager, I'm here to ensure that each team and member of that team are working and growing to achieve their highest output and personal performance.

## I am committed to:

- Creating the opportunity for you to make the best design work of your career.
- Providing a safe space for you to grow personally and professionally.
- Listening and learning to always find the best way to work and grow together.

## I will hold myself accountable to:

- Taking responsibility for my actions.
- To follow through on my commitments and promises.
- To recognize my mistakes and make changes so as not to repeat them.

## I will respect you individually:

- I am committed to getting to know you as a unique person.
- I welcome feedback in order to strive for excellence and will provide feedback to you.
- I try my best to be real and vulnerable and seek the same in others.

## How I will work with you:

- I am a transparent person and carry this trait over to my management style. If I don't know the answer or am unable to share information, then I will tell you.
- My success comes from your success. I will not take credit for your or someone else's work. I want you to receive the accolade for any work that you design, not me.
- I will strive to protect you from drama and politics. I will be the first one to take any blowback from outside the team so that this doesn't affect you or your work.
- I expect us all to be kind to one another and avoid gossip or negativity as it affects the morale of the team and hinders what we can accomplish together.
- I am a positive, social person, I view life and our job as a privilege and hope that we can crack jokes and have as much fun as possible together.
- I view management as an opportunity to be a coach and a friend. If you ask me for advice, I will gladly give it. If you want to figure out things on your own, I will not look over your shoulder.
- I will always be here for you, even if we aren't working together anymore.
